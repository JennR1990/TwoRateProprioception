In this project we set out to investigate 1) how quickly proprioception recalibrates, and 2) to disentangle it from the updating of predicted sensory consequences. Furthermore, it has been suggested that proprioceptive recalibration could be the result of implicit learning. Since implicit learning has been shown to be reated to the "slow" process [@McDougle2015] in the two-rate model [@Smith2006], we will test if the slow process as fitted to the reach data relates to our measure of proprioceptive recalibration.

To do all this we use a trial-by-trial approach, that is: one reach-training trial is followed by one of various "measurement" trials
